# Teach me about Crucibles

## What is a Crucible?

A Crucible is an ERC-721 NFT (Non-Fungible Token) which is minted via [crucible.wtf](https://crucible.wtf) ([How do I mint a Crucible](guides-1/how-do-i-mint-a-crucible.md)). Crucibles are stored in an Ethereum wallet and can be used as a smart wallet for other ERC20 tokens.

This gives two immediate benefits;

1. &#x20;Separate asset management between Crucibles while maintaining a single wallet
2. The ability to transfer your Crucible with its contained assets between wallets in a single transaction.

So understanding that a Crucible is able to hold ERC20 tokens, this also opens the possibility to store LP tokens within a Crucible as well. LP tokens are commonly used to participate in staking programs and earn some form of rewards. Taking part in these staking programs would usually mean transferring custody/ownership of your tokens in order to accrue rewards.

Crucibles allow you to do things differently, in addition to being a smart wallet, Crucibles also contain a vault mechanism that allows you to stake your tokens to **non-custodial** reward programs, locking them within the Crucible until you leave a program — i.e. earn rewards without giving up possession of your tokens.

Not only is your Crucible smart and capable, it also has [artwork](guides-1/artwork-of-the-crucible.md) that is able to evolve over time based on your activity.

## What is an NFT?

It stands for Non-Fungible Token. "Non-fungible" means "unique" unlike a standard token which shares the same token address, an NFT has it's own unique address.

NFTs are a direct contrast to coins:

* Coins: 1⚗️ is 1⚗️, they have equivalent value and use
* NFTs: a Crucible NFT is not equal to another Crucible NFT and it is very unlikely that any two Crucibles have equivalent value

This is an important point to understand, because people have [already started listing](https://opensea.io/collection/alchemist-crucible-v1) their Crucibles for sale on platforms such as OpenSea.

## How do you mint a Crucible?

Please use the guide [How do I mint a Crucible?](guides-1/how-do-i-mint-a-crucible.md) to learn the steps to mint your first Crucible.

## What is a Crucible worth?

The value of a Crucible is not one that is determined by its [traits](guides-1/artwork-of-the-crucible.md) alone.

Crucibles have been designed to hold all types of ERC20 tokens including those with an underlying value such as an LP token. Crucibles can also store ETH, so when determining the value of a Crucible, its underlying assets will have a direct impact on its value.

Assets that are also 'staked' or 'subscribed' to programs within a Crucible may have accrued rewards which have been unclaimed, this is a further measurable value that can be considered when evaluating a Crucible.

At a minimum, you could value a Crucible based on what you would receive back for unsubscribing its LP contents and trading back to your fiat currency.

Refer to [this section](guides-1/what-can-i-do-with-my-new-crucible.md#checking-how-much-lp-youve-subscribed-to-your-crucible) below for methods to check the contents of a Crucible.

## Should you mint a Crucible?

There are many benefits for owning and using a Crucible but a few key factors to consider.

* [The cost of minting](./#the-cost-of-minting)
* [True non-custodial participation](./#true-non-custodial-participation)
* [Transferring assets efficiently between wallets](./#transferring-assets-efficiently-between-wallets)
* [Managing multiple portfolios within a single wallet](./#managing-multiple-portfolios-within-a-single-wallet)
* [Crucibles evolve based on your activity](./#crucibles-evolve-based-on-your-activity)

#### The cost of minting

When dealing with Ethereum based tokens and contracts you will face gas fees at almost every stage.&#x20;

Gas prices continuously fluctuate and this plays a major role on how much gas you are expected to pay, for this reason we are unable to give an indication.

We can say however, that you should take into account the value of your tokens against the cost of gas when you are about to submit a transaction to mint or interact with a Crucible/reward program.

#### True non-custodial participation

Crucibles have been designed so you can gain rewards on underlying tokens within your Crucible without transferring the tokens away to third party contracts.\
\
This is done by the Vault mechanism of your Crucible that interacts with the reward program contracts to verify the token balance and lock it against the delegate.

When you are subscribed to a reward program, you are still holding your tokens within your Crucible, and your Crucible remains within your Wallet.

#### Transferring assets efficiently between wallets

You can use your Crucible as a method of storage for your ERC20 tokens and ETH, and fast and efficiently transfer your Crucible between your wallets. This means your Crucible and its underlying tokens will be transferred between your wallets in a single transaction.

#### Managing multiple portfolios within a single wallet

Crucibles enable you to be able to hold multiple inventories within a single wallet/EOA. \
You can use a Crucible to store specific assets that you want to separate from other asset holdings in your wallet, or even hold multiple Crucibles and store different tokens in each Crucible.\
\
This is particularly useful if you are holding assets on behalf of others or wish to benchmark different strategies with different Crucibles.

This also means you can even sell a Crucible complete with its underlying assets in a single bundle.

#### Crucibles evolve based on your activity (Pro/Platinum Crucibles only)

Crucible artwork is not just an image or a video, but it’s an interactive visualization, fully 3D and rendered in real-time. It’s not only a generative piece of art based on your crucible ID, but also an evolving and living companion to your DeFi journey. The Crucible artwork will change with time and with your interactions, and will also act as a gateway to future possibilities with the Alchemist ecosystem.

## What wallets can I use to store my Crucible?

Crucibles are ERC-721 tokens and signing these transactions are not supported by all Wallet Applications.&#x20;

Please refer to our [wallet compatibility guide.](wallet-compatibility.md)

## How many LP tokens do I need to create a Platinum Crucible?

Community members have successfully minted a Platinum Crucible with as low as 0.01 LP tokens.

Of course, a Crucible still costs gas to mint, so please take into consideration this cost when creating one with minimal LP.

Remember, you earn rewards proportional to your LP share of the total LP staked in the Aludel v1.5.

## Can I create multiple Crucibles?

Yes you can. Many users in the community have already minted multiple Crucibles, at the time of writing there are more than 12% of unique EOAs with multiple Crucibles.

## How do I view my tokens on MetaMask?

Refer to [our FAQ ](https://app.gitbook.com/@alchemist-docs/s/crucible/frequently-asked-questions)on the addresses that you need to add to your wallet to be able to see the token.
