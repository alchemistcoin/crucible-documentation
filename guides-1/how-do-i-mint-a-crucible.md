## Swapping and Subscribing $MIST ⚗️ to mint a Crucible

First of all, you need to have ⚗️-WETH LP from the [Uniswap-V2 Liquidity pool](https://lp.mist.alchemist.wtf).

If you have not done this already, please refer to our 2-part guide on [Acquiring ⚗️ & Adding Liquidity](../acquiring-and-adding-liquidity.md).

## Minting a Crucible using ⚗️-WETH LP tokens

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important information:** 

Do not use Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail, resulting in lost fees. 

The only currently compatible hardware wallet is Ledger, many others do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When other hardware wallets implement this feature they will become compatible.
