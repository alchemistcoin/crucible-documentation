There are a few precautions to take before taking part in the Crucible program, please be sure to read the notices and warnings below before continuing.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important Notice**  
Crucibles can only be minted from **Uniswap V2** LP Tokens.  
Please make sure you are adding tokens to the V2 pool and not V3.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
* **Do not** use  Brave browser as it is not compatible with the process at this time and your transaction will fail, resulting in lost fees.
* The only currently compatible hardware wallet is Ledger, many others do not currently support EIP-712 signing. When other hardware wallets implement this feature they will become compatible.
* Some users have reported issues with Trust Wallet. Please express caution when using it.
* We do not recommend you do any of these processes on a mobile device.
