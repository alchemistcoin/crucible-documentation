# Using your Crucible as a Smart Wallet/Vault

We've now made it easier for you to manage assets by using your Crucible via [crucible.alchemist.wtf](https://crucible.alchemist.wtf)

You can easily transfer ERC20 tokens in and out of your Crucible and use your Crucible as a Vault.

This also means moving around your assets is much easier as you can easily transfer a Crucible full of tokens to another wallet with a single transaction.
