# Claiming Rewards & Unsubscribing your Tokens

At some point you may decide that you are ready to Claim your rewards and Unsubscribe your tokens from a reward program

The guide below is designed to step you through that process.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that when you unsubscribe all of the staking token or only a portion of your staking token from the crucible, the reward multiplier for the unsubscribed staking tokens will be reset while the subscribed portion will remain at its current multiplier.&#x20;

For example, suppose you have 1.7 ⚗️-WETH LP subscribed and its reward multiplier is at 10x. You decide to unsubscribe 1 ⚗️-WETH LP. The 0.7 ⚗️-WETH LP remaining (still subscribed) will continue to have a reward multiplier of 10x, while the unsubscribed 1 ⚗️-WETH LP's reward multiplier will be reset.&#x20;

The rewards you receive will be from the unsubscribed 1 ⚗️-WETH LP, not the subscribed 0.7 ⚗️-WETH LP.
