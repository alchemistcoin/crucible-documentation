# Using your Crucible as a Smart Wallet/Vault

We've now made it easier for you to manage assets by using your Crucible via [crucible.alchemist.wtf](https://crucible.alchemist.wtf)

You can easily transfer ERC20 tokens in and out of your Crucible and use your Crucible as a Vault.

This also means moving around your assets is much easier as you can easily transfer a Crucible full of tokens to another wallet with a single transaction.

### Viewing your Crucible Contents

1. Open the "Your Crucibles" page
2. Locate the crucible you wish to interact with, and select it by clicking on it if it's not already selected. \
