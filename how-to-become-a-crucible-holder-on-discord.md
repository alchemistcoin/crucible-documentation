If you own a Crucible, you can become a 'Crucible Holder' in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/qWQQMMKjKe) üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öóÔ∏è. One perk of becoming a Crucible Holder is that it allows you to take part in discord votes and competitions.

If your Crucible was minted using the online site, please jump to [**Part 2**](how-to-become-a-crucible-holder-on-discord.md#part-2)****

If your Crucible was minted using [command line](https://github.com/alchemistcoin/alchemist), you need to log into a new MetaMask account using the mnemonics from your command line wallet. This is shown in [**Part 1**](how-to-become-a-crucible-holder-on-discord.md#part-1)****

## **Part 1**

1. In your new MetaMask wallet, import your seed phrase (mnemonics) obtained when creating your wallet using command line &#x20;
