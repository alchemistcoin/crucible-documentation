# Getting Started

Launching a reward program with Crucible has no charge, please reach out to our team on Discord and they will assist you to launch a reward program on the platform.

As Crucible does not rely on any fees from Reward Programs, support us by considering to use [additional services that we offer](services-and-fees.md) for a nominal fee, this helps support our projects continued development.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The reward program contracts also do not deduct any fees from reward token deposits, however this may change in the future.&#x20;

**Programs existing before a fee introduction will not be affected.**
{% endhint %}

We've included as much useful information as we could to help you make an informed decision, please find the topics below:

* [Why use Crucible?](why-should-i-consider-crucible.md)
* [Reward Program Mechanics](reward-program-contracts.md)
* [Reward Program Configuration](reward-program-configuration.md)
* [Services and Fees](services-and-fees.md)
