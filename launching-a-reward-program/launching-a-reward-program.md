# Launching a reward program

Launching a reward program with Crucible has no charge, please reach out to our team on Discord and they will assist you to launch a reward program on the platform.

As Crucible does not rely on any fees from Reward Programs, support us by considering to use [additional services that we offer](services-and-fees.md) for a nominal fee, this helps support our projects continued development.

The reward program contracts also do not deduct any fees from reward token deposits, however this may change in the future.&#x20;

**Please note that any programs existing before a fee introduction will not be subject to a fee.**
