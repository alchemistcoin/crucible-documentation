The reward program coin displayed on a users Crucible artwork is permament and holds historical participation data for the user even after they've left a program.

Only 1 coin is required per project and can be utilised across all reward programs launched by the project.

The cost of having your own Reward Program coin is `1 ETH` per network/chain. The fee is one-off and the coin can be reutilised in the future.
